<h2>Commons-SSL</h2>
<p>Requires Java 1.3.x or higher.
<br/>Some features require Java 1.4.x or higher.</p>
<p>Please see our <a href="ssl.html">ssl page</a> for code examples on how to use this library.</a>
<h4>5 Design Goals:</h4>
<ol>
<li  style="margin-top: 6px;"><b>Make SSL and Java Easier.</b>  Ever wanted to work with self-signed
certificates in your Java application in a secure fashion?  Ever wanted to use more than one client
certificte in a single running JVM?  You can edit your <code>$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts</code>
file, and you can invoke Java with <code>-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/path/to/keystore</code>.  Both of
these approaches are great at first, but they don't scale well.  Do you really want to pollute every
SSL socket in your JVM (HTTP, LDAP, JDBC, RMI, etc...) with those system-wide changes?  Commons-SSL let's you
control the SSL options you need in an natural way for each SSLSocketFactory, and those options
won't bleed into the rest of your system.</li>
<li  style="margin-top: 6px;"><b>Improve Security.</b>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list">CRL</a> checking turned on by default.
We hope to add support for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol">OCSP</a> soon!
It's obnoxious to have to download CRL files around 500KB each from Thawte and Verisign every 24 hours.
OCSP improves on that.</li>
<li  style="margin-top: 6px;"><b>Improve Flexibility.</b>  Checking hostnames, expirations, CRL's, and many
other options can be enabled/disabled for each SSLSocketFactory created.</li>
<li style="margin-top: 6px;"><b>Support more file formats, and support these formats more robustly.</b>
<ul>
<li>commons-ssl supports over <a href="samples/rsa_result.html">50 formats</a> of PKCS8 and OpenSSL Encrypted Private Keys in PEM or DER</li>
<li>X.509 Certificates can be PEM or DER encoded.  Can also come in PKCS7 chains.  (To be fair, Java always supported this.)</li>
<li>PKCS12 files can be in <a href="samples/pkcs12/pkcs12_client_cert.pem">PEM</a> (as created by <code>openssl pkcs12</code>).</li>
<li>Parsing of Base64-PEM is more tolerant of extra whitespace or comments, especially outside the Base64 sections:
<pre style="padding-left: 100px;">any comments or whitespace up here are ignored

-----BEGIN TYPE-----
[...base64....]
-----END TYPE-----

any comments or whitespace down here are also ignored</pre></li></ul></li>
<li><b>Automatically detect type of KeyMaterial or TrustMaterial.</b>  Consumer does not need to know
whether keystore is PKCS12 or JKS.  They just need to know the password to decrypt the private key.</li>
</ol>

<h4>About</h4>
<p>Commons-SSL was originally developed by
<a href="https://www.cucbc.com">Credit Union Central of British Columbia</a>.
It was donated to the Apache Software Foundation in August 2006.
</p>
<p>The ASN.1 parsing code was originally developed by the Apache Directory Project
(<a href="http://directory.apache.org/">directory.apache.org</a>).</p>
<p>The PKCS12 key derivation function (for some PKCS8 version 1.5 encrypted keys) was cut &amp; paste from
BouncyCastle (<a href="http://bouncycastle.org/">bouncycastle.org</a>).  They 
originally got it from RSA's PKCS12 specification
(<a href="ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-12/pkcs-12v1.pdf">ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-12/pkcs-12v1.pdf</a>),
so I hope this copy &amp; paste operation is
okay!</p>
<p>Commons-SSL would never have happened without Oleg Kalnichevski's excellent "contrib" example in the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/">HttpClient</a> SVN repository.
His 
<a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/jakarta/commons/proper/httpclient/trunk/src/contrib/org/apache/commons/httpclient/contrib/ssl/AuthSSLProtocolSocketFactory.java?revision=376971&amp;view=markup">AuthSSLProtocolSocketFactory.java</a>
and
<a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/jakarta/commons/proper/httpclient/trunk/src/contrib/org/apache/commons/httpclient/contrib/ssl/AuthSSLX509TrustManager.java?revision=376759&amp;view=markup">AuthSSLX509TrustManager.java</a>
examples
were the seeds for all of this.  Evil Comrade Oleg's Javadocs on those classes were also extremely helpful.  We
only one day hope that we can write Javadocs like that (maybe by 0.7.5?).
